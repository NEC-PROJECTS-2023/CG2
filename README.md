<h2>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h2>
A chronic eye condition called glaucoma has a deleterious effect on the optic nerve, which carries visual data from the brain to the eye. Early detection is essential for stopping the condition's progression. Glaucoma is one of the most prevalent eye conditions, and it's important to catch it early because it can cause blindness and neurological issues. In this study, a neural network convolutional suggested (CNN) system for the early detection of glaucoma. The system utilizes enlarged images of the eyes as input data for deep learning. The eye images undergo pre-processing to eliminate any noise and prepare them for further analysis. When new eye images are fed into the proposed system, it uses the features it learned during training to classify the images as either having normal pupils or being affected by glaucoma.
